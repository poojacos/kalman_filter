# kalman_filter
This project implements a Kalman filter to track three dimensional orientation. Given IMU sensor readings from gyroscopes and accelerometers, the task is to estimate the underlying 3D orientation by determining the appropriate model parameters from ground truth data given by a Vicon motion capture system.
This project mainly revolves around implementing the algorithm described in this paper: [A Quaternion-base Unscented Kalman Filter for Orientation Tracking](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-quaternion-based-unscented-Kalman-filter-for-Kraft/2d211ba91a30f9ece9eef098a009a4e1465c8c44?p2df).

A detailed problem description can be found in the hw2.pdf uploaded. This project was part of the ESE 650 course.
